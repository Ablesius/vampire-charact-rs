# Vampire-Charact-rs

Character sheet management for Vampire: the Masquerade, written in Rust

<!-- Note: Markdown *reference* links don't seem to work on Github README files, so always use the [default](https://example.org) format. -->

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

*

### Installing

```
cargo build --release
```

### Executing program

Your character sheets have to be json files. Run this:
```
cargo run --release -- path/to/a/directory
```

This will list out the available files. Note that your character sheets have to have the `.json` file ending, or vampire-charact-rs will not recognise them or consider them character sheets. You should also not have any other json files in this directory.
