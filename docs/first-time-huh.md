# First time contributing

So, you want to give me feedback for my little app? 🤓

🧛🏻  **Vampire-Charact-rs** is a character sheet management tool for [Vampire the Masquerade 5th edition](https://renegadegamestudios.com/pdf-vampire-the-masquerade/), "V5" 🧛🏻.
At the time of writing, the tool is still at the early stages of development.
Eventually I'd like to build something like [The One App](https://gitlab.com/loikki/the-one-app), a character management app that is even available for Android.

At the moment, vampire-charact-rs is just a command-line tool with limited functionality.

## Instructions

If you want to help me test it, you'll have to learn how to compile rust code ⚙️ 🛠️
That isn't terribly difficult: follow the instructions here: [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
(if you're on Linux, use your package manager! For **Windows** or **Mac**, the installation guide you'll be shown on that page will probably be the best way).
For more information check out [the Rust Book's Installation section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

The rest should be simple from here: clone my repository on Github 💻 (or, if you don't have git, download the zip archive 📂 and extract it somewhere).
In the extracted folder, execute the commands as described in my [README](../README.md).

And then, give feedback! 🗣️

"doesn't work", "how do I do this, I don't understand", "this is cool, could you add..." is all welcome!

If you want to, I will add your name to the list of [Acknowledgements](../README.md#acknowledgments)... or maybe to some Easter egg feature ☺️
